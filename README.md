# ForMold

Hi everyone. I don't know what I doing, but I have a idea for library who help to create html form fast, easy and flexibly and (currently) I cannot use git and his commands.

Name created from two words - "form" and "mold" who after join is "forMold".

This library is for version PHP >= 5.4
